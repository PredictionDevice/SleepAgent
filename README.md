# The Sleep Agent

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended to document and analyze a set of experiences from a sleep journal from a subject (myself) with an unknown inheritable sleep disorder (as diagnosed), the following repository does not constitute proof but is instead the works of speculative analysis and is not to be considered factual; there's no guarantee of the accuracy of the methods, descriptions and procedures in this document; and none of the information included here should be considered medical advice nor should serve as a substitute from an accreddited professional in the field.

The set of notes and experiences is currently several hundred of pages long, this raw content will not be posted given its personal information and dense language riddled with mispells and time skips that cannot be easily understood; during these episodes of constant sleep paralysis, hypnagogic jerks, and out of body experiences of extreme intensity; a pattern of extreme complexity seems to emerge, and this is an attempt to describe it.

A clear bias is established, as the subject (myself) can only use what is avaliable to understand this pattern; this document will therefore have a similar writing style and conformation to that used in software architeching, engineering and machine design; a brain can only use what is available to explain its own experience, therefore this document is not exempt of bias.

This document is not light to read, as the complexity of the experience is beyond what one could simply put in words. Think of this repository as observations of a simple engineer trying to explain a machine of utterly extreme complexity.
