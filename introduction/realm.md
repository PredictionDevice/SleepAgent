# The Realm of the Unconscious

## The modern unconscious

The concept of the unconscious has been described as this description of processes that occur in the background of the self, however little of it is known or has been studied in modernity compared to the development in other areas; Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung are some examples of individuals that have studied and brought this concept into the mainstream, however little progress has been brought into it and no modern knowledge has been applied as it has been replaced by a rigid form of cognitive science (with a lot of merit, but at the same time a lot of focus on what is immediately measurable).

We do still accept that there are forms of thought and brain activity that the individual is unaware of, yet we tend to give it little importance and assume that it's mostly the aware and communicating part of the self the one that specifies the expression of a given organism in possession of a brain; but if anything changes in hormones, unknown diseases such as anemia, pituitary problems, thyroid problems and even gut issues can causes changes in behavior and perception, which the "communicating" part of the self will try to make explanations for, even if those are not accurate, and its current state is not but a mere result of chemistry.

While these processes that are hormonal in nature are often not considered to be part of the unconscious, it should make one ponder on the reliability of language and other forms of communication on whether it is truly in control as it believes; or whether the brain is a compound of many different synchronized mechanisms that more or less agree on their current state and have functions on execution and understanding, and as long as it's good enough for survival the awareness of the communicating part of the brain does not need to be aware of this complexity within itself, and when it can't understand its experience, it will try to make something up to explain its current state.

## The ancient unconscious

However, the original form of the unconscious that has been explored since ancient times is the mystical realm, because that is the form as perceived by the brain itself; the usual lack of awareness of the self over this form of thought makes it believe that it is external to itself once it’s accessed, the amount of information and complexity is overwhelming, symbolic and often provides a lot of information.

But it is not external, however without a scientific method this connection could not have been established until fairly recently, hence spirits, demons, and other symbolism of the unconscious were attributed to external factors.

What is referred to this mystical realm and odd common beliefs of the dead communicating with the living (among other beliefs), is but an exposition of the internal mechanisms of the unconscious mind; which is not lacking of merit, this mystical realm defined as the unconscious mind is far more complex and rich than a external one.

The unconscious and the form it takes isn’t unique to humans, it’s simply a display of pattern recognition mechanisms that go beyond our own personal understanding; the mystical realm is how the brain thinks and processes patterns, and mystical experiences are but this machine going a bit overboard and presenting too much information to the speaking/perceiving agent.

As for why it takes this form of mystical realms and religious beliefs, section 2, on entities will discuss this further on why this is surely the result of emergence working within random chance; the same way something as complex as cells were formed in a soup of organic matter; it is but a similar design.

## The unconscious expression and psychoactives

Accessing too much of the unconscious process is dangerous, no agent in control of the limbs, communication, and other expression can possibly focus on survival while having an exponentially complex experience manifest into them; the unconscious expressing itself in such a manner is often a threat to life.

As a result brain development of organisms instead try to be resilient to this, keeping the unconscious processes separate in order to focus on survival and taking only what is necessary.

Sleep plays a big role in this, by keeping the unconscious at bay; and while the mechanisms on how this may work will be discussed further, sleep deprivation often leads to psychotic effects and eventual death as a result of both the necessary physical requirements that occur during sleep but also the modifications and exploration of the unconscious that occur during sleep that are quintessential to this order.

And as a result plants and other organisms that are often consumed by herbivores or omnivores will do the opposite, whatever regulation mechanisms of the mind are in place they are affected by chemicals and hormones; hijacking these systems of control and exposing the mind to its own complexity will result in an organism having an experience that places a threat to life; for many herbivores will avoid this just like any other toxin, the target organism doesn’t know what it’s doing, it isn’t following a script, it simply found a molecule that works to deter its consumption for nourishment by natural selection.

Humans are some of the few animals that chase this sort of experience, humans can be protected by other humans because they are social creatures, as well as build very safe shelters; hence forcing an expression of the unconscious is not much life threatening; similar things could be said about dolphins, jaguars, monkeys, large herbivores for a habitat with little predators and such; while exceptions may arise, an organism that gets high in psychoactive substances requires to guarantee its safety first and foremost.

The first exploration of this state done by humans was often attributed to it being external, our ancestors weren’t even sure they had a thinking center in themselves, less be sure of their location because it is not required for survival; hence they couldn’t possibly realize that this experience radicates within themselves.

Of course it does seem external because what the brain perceives as external (such as reality) is also internal in nature, the brain doesn’t really understand raw reality; it's all an interpretation, or rather, a “prediction” of reality.

## Psychosis

What we refer to as psychosis is rather higher awareness of the unconscious processes, the experiences (especially those hallucinatory in nature) are the product of the unconscious which would otherwise be unable to be expressed by either not matching reality or being a hindrance to the interpretation of reality.

These processes do still exist in “healthy” individuals, not every pattern in existence within an organism is a sensical pattern nor one that matches reality.

The higher degree of complexity among all animals, and the special complexity of the patterns that are constructed, and the safety humans have to be capable of experiencing these unconscious processes while still remaining somewhat functional in a society or tribe makes humans a species in particular risk of developing psychosis as they evolved with smaller pressures being a tribal species and higher risk spectrum due to having a complex brain with the most complex patterns of understanding; unlike other more resilient organisms, which pretty much make up for the rest of the animal kingdom making psychosis a particularly human process.

Still psychosis is such a problem that we would expect it to be more common yet it’s relatively rare even within humans, having on average a 2 out of 100 people matching this criteria and yet most of it is relatively mild as the organism remains functional; an animal with such mild level of psychosis could never be established as a delusion can easily be attributed to lack of intelligence.

This dysfunction of psychosis proves that access to the unconscious is a rather unwanted trait, it dissociates the organism with reality and reduces its chances of survival; and yet a psychotic person even those experiencing hallucinations isn’t even close to the potential higher effect that can be achieved via drugs like DMT and Salvia.

## Dreams

Dreams are the most common form of accessing parts of the unconscious mind, it is however rather limited and often comes with selective amnesia and other than in exceptional scenarios dreams have no meaning in specific but instead are an exploration of what currently exists in the unconscious that holds high priority and importance and can match reality to a degree.

Paralysis also occurs because the experience of these unconscious mechanisms in an unconscious realm may lead to acting it out which can hurt the organism in question. Since sleep is a key aspect for a functioning brain, paralysis evolved alongside it.

The self imposed limitations on this experience ensure the safety of the organism and the selective amnesia helps with the suspension of disbelief as well as keeping things fuzzy to prevent the individual confusing a dream event with a real event.

From all the forms of unconscious exploration, dreams have an aspect that makes them feel like a “controlled state”, however if anything the speaking/perceiving agent is not in control, but dreams aren’t fully random but instead it’s filled with common elements.
