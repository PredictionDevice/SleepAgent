# The Realm of the Unconscious

## The modern unconscious

The concept of the unconscious has been described as a set of processes that occur in the background of the self, however little of it is known or has been studied in modernity compared to the development that has occurred in other areas.

Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung are some examples of individuals that have studied and brought this concept into the mainstream, however little progress has been brought into it and no modern knowledge has been applied as it has been replaced by a rigid form of cognitive science (with a lot of merit, but at the same time a lot of focus on what is immediately measurable).

We do still accept that there are forms of thought that the individual is unaware of, yet we tend to give it little importance and assume that it's mostly the aware and communicating part of the self the one that specifies the expression of a given organism in possession of a brain. But if anything changes in hormones, unknown diseases such as anemia, pituitary problems, thyroid problems and even gut issues can causes changes in behavior and perception, which the "communicating" part of the self will try to make explanations for, even if those are not accurate, and its current state is not but a mere result of chemistry.

While these processes are hormonal in nature and are often not to be considered part of the unconscious, it should make one ponder on the reliability of language and other forms of communication on whether it is truly in control as it believes; or whether the brain is a compound of many different synchronized mechanisms that more or less agree on their current state and have functions on execution and understanding, so as long as it's good enough for survival, the communicating part of the brain does not need to be aware of the complexity within itself, and when it can't understand its experience, it will try to make something up to explain its current state rather that accepting ignorance of its own internal processes.

## The ancient unconscious

The original form of the unconscious that has been explored since ancient times is the mystical realm, because this is the expression of the unconscious as perceived by the brain itself. The usual lack of awareness of the perceiving/speaking self over this form of thought makes it believe that it is external to itself once it’s accessed, the amount of information and complexity is overwhelming and of symbolic nature.

But it is not external as our ancestors had believed; however, without a scientific method this connection could have not been possibly established, hence spirits, demons, and other symbolism of the unconscious were attributed to external factors.

What is referred to as the mystical realm and the beliefs of the dead communicating with the living, spirits, creatures, legends (among other beliefs), is but an exposition of the internal mechanisms of the unconscious mind. Such a proposal is not lacking merit, as this mystical realm defined as the unconscious mind is far more complex and rich than an external one because it implies that despite similarities, each brain holds its own version.

The unconscious and the form it takes isn’t unique to humans, as every creature in possession of a brain must hold it in one form or another, as it’s simply a display of pattern recognition mechanisms that go beyond our own personal understanding. The mystical realm is how the brain thinks and processes patterns, and mystical experiences are but this machine going a bit overboard and presenting too much information to the speaking/perceiving agent.

As for why it takes this specific form that seems to transcend culture and personal beliefs (and instead the mystical experience is defined by the unconscious), section 2, on entities will discuss this further on why this is surely the result of emergence working within random chance. The same way something as complex as cells were formed in a soup of organic matter, the unconscious mind emerges within the pattern recognition machinery of the brain, it is but a similar design.

## The unconscious expression and psychoactives

Accessing too much of the unconscious process is dangerous, as no agent in control of the limbs, communication, and other expression can possibly focus on survival while having an exponentially complex experience manifest into them; the unconscious expressing itself in such a manner is often a threat to life.

As a result brain development of organisms instead try to be resilient to this, keeping the unconscious processes separate in order to focus on survival and taking only what is necessary.

Sleep plays a big role in this, by keeping the unconscious at bay (the mechanisms on how this may work will be discussed later). Sleep deprivation often leads to psychotic effects and eventual death as the result of both, lack of the necessary physical restorative effects and the modifications and exploration of the unconscious mind that occur during sleep that are quintessential to this order.

And as a result plants, fungi and other organisms that are often consumed by heterotrophs will do the opposite and attempt to disrupt this balance. Whatever regulation mechanisms of the mind are in place are inherently affected by chemicals and hormones; hijacking these systems of control and exposing the mind to its own complexity will result in an organism having an experience that places a threat to life; for many herbivores will avoid consumption of these organisms just like any other toxin.

The potentially consumed organism doesn’t know what it’s doing, it isn’t following a script, it simply found a molecule that works to deter its consumption for nourishment by natural selection.

Humans are some of the few animals that chase this sort of experience, they can be protected by other humans because they are social creatures, as well as build very safe shelters. Hence forcing an expression of the unconscious is not much life threatening; similar things could be said about dolphins, jaguars, monkeys, large herbivores for a habitat with little predators that place a threat to them, etcetera. And while exceptions may arise, an organism that gets high in psychoactive substances requires to guarantee its own safety first and foremost.

The first exploration of these altered states of consciousness via psychoactives done by humans were often attributed to it being external, our ancestors weren’t even sure they had a thinking center in themselves, less be sure of their location because it is not required for survival; hence they couldn’t possibly realize that this experience radicates with the toxin disrupting the regulation mechanisms of the unconscious mind within their own brains.

It does seem external because what the brain perceives as external (such as reality) is also internal in nature, the brain doesn’t really understand raw reality; it's all an interpretation, or rather, a “prediction” of reality.

## Psychosis

What we refer to as psychosis is rather higher awareness of the unconscious processes, the experiences (especially those hallucinatory in nature) are the product of the unconscious which would otherwise be unable to be expressed by either not matching reality or being a hindrance to the interpretation of reality.

These processes do still exist in “healthy” individuals, not every pattern in existence within an organism is a sensical pattern, nor one that matches reality.

The safety of human settlements and social bonds, makes humans capable of experiencing these unconscious processes while still remaining somewhat functional in a society or tribe. Also, the higher degree of complexity humans have among animals, and the special complexity of the patterns that are constructed within the mind makes humans a species in particular risk of developing psychosis as they evolved with smaller pressures being a tribal species and higher risk spectrum due to having a complex brain holding complex patterns. Unlike other more resilient organisms, which pretty much make up for the rest of the animal kingdom, making psychosis a particularly human process.

Still, psychosis is such a problem that we would expect it to be more common yet it’s relatively rare even within humans, having on average a 2 out of 100 people matching this criteria and yet most of it is relatively mild as in most cases the organism remains functional and likely to reproduce; a non-human animal with such mild level of psychosis could never be established as a delusion can easily be attributed to lack of intelligence.

This dysfunction of psychosis proves that access to the unconscious is a rather unwanted trait, it dissociates the organism with reality and reduces its chances of survival; and yet a psychotic person even those experiencing hallucinations isn’t even close to the potential higher effect that can be achieved via drugs like DMT and Salvia.

## Dreams

Dreams are the most common form of accessing parts of the unconscious mind, it is however rather limited and often comes with selective amnesia and other than in exceptional scenarios dreams have no meaning in specific but instead are an exploration of what currently exists within the unconscious that holds high priority and can match reality to a degree. Dreams tend to have a relationship to what was experienced recently because these were patterns of interest, strong experiences and childhood experiences tend to flow into dreams because they hold special importance as being a basis of other patterns.

But due to the unconscious nature where not all patterns used for thought are sensical or logical, but only its final result is as expressed by the speaking/perceiving agent, dreams have an uncanny magical nature, as they often don’t make sense when placed against reality.

A dream element or pattern codes to what it exactly is, people will often try to find special meaning to what they have dreamed; but the symbolic nature of dreams is often as it is, something simply exists within the unconscious mind and doesn’t have to mean anything in particular. It codes for the identification and execution for the pattern in question; regardless of how unlikely or weird.

It may seem meaningful to the dreamer because their own unconscious expresses a pattern that is contained within itself that simply exists, and if it exists it’s easy to imagine that it must speak something about oneself; and while in some cases that is true, for the most part, it is not.

Humans, which are particularly visual, will tend to focus on the visual nature of dreams and their meaning, yet patterns of movement and proprioception are experienced just as much, many of which may not make sense when placed against reality (such as the perception of flying or slowed down movement); but little is spoken about the meaning of these patterns that code for other senses.

It’s simply a prediction pattern making up a story in absence of perceptive input, and the contents of this story may change depending on factors such as stress, medical conditions, hormones, or drugs.

Even in these few exceptions on cases where flashbacks are experienced for traumatic reasons causing nightmare disorders, or worries popping into dreams; these are simply displaying the tendencies and patterns already existing in the unconscious; the pattern is expressed as it is, the experience is executed as it is; there is no need for interpretation, the dreamer often gets a very clear message of the significance of the experience and what it entails. And while it may seem frustrating to have a very intense experience that seems to be meaningless, dreams often code to exactly what they are, regardless of the person's beliefs; because that’s how reality also works.

And the unconscious is attempting to replicate that by containing patterns to help it understand reality, dreams don’t define the person, they don’t speak of someone’s personality or personal beliefs; they are patterns of the unconscious being explored without perceptive input, and these patterns are there to interpret reality even if these mechanisms go overboard and do not describe reality well during dreaming because of the lack of perceptive input to setup a determination.

While dreaming, paralysis also occurs because the experience of these unconscious mechanisms are not simply visual. But some of them describe movement and will lead to acting them out which can hurt the organism in question. Since sleep is a key aspect for a functioning brain, paralysis evolved alongside it.

The self imposed limitations on this experience ensure the safety of the organism and the selective amnesia helps with the suspension of disbelief as well as keeping things fuzzy to prevent the individual confusing a dream event with a real event.
